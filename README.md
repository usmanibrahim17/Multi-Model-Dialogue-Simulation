Multi-Model Dialogue Simulation

A fun but technical experiment where three different Large Language Models (LLMs) — OpenAI’s GPT, Anthropic’s Claude, and Google’s Gemini — engage in a simulated group chat. Each model is given a unique persona (snarky, polite, melancholic) to explore how personalities emerge when AI systems interact.

🚀 Features

Three Models Talking: GPT, Claude, and Gemini converse in a loop.

Custom Personas:

GPT → argumentative & snarky

Claude → polite & agreeable

Gemini → sad & melancholic

Conversation History Handling: Keeps track of dialogue so each model can “remember” context.

Configurable Rounds: Easily adjust the number of interaction cycles.
